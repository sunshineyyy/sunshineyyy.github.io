I have been working on an iOS app called [FishToxicity](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fishtoxicity/id1078063422?ls=1&mt=8) primarily designed for pregnant women to check mercury level in fish with data from FDA. Recently, I have feedback from users in China asking for Chinese translations of the app. It seems a straightforward process but it turns out there is not a super good tutorial to guide you through the process. During my learning process, I figured out a pretty neat way to add these translations based on this simple framework called [Localize-Swift](https://github.com/marmelroy/Localize-Swift).
