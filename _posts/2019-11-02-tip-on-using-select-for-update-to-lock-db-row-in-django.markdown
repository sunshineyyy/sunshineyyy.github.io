# Introduction


# Prerequisites 
* An AWS EC2 instance set up
* Basic Git knowledge and a working Github account. [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) on Git and Github if you need.
* Basic command line knowledge
* Basic knowledge of Node.js

# Fork AngularJS app code
For this tutorial, we'll be using the [PhoneCat Tutorial App](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat) from AngularJS. This is the offical [tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/) from AngularJS. I highly recommend you to go through if you are starting on AgularJS.

To begin, let's [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) [PhoneCat Tutorial App](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat) on Github. You should then have a repo under your name like [this](https://github.com/yaoyuyang/angular-phonecat) forked from angular/angular-phonecat.

# SSH into EC2 and git clone code
Now SSH into your EC2 instance. Type `ls` to see the directories. You should see something like the following:
![sshls](/images/blog/sshls.png){:class="img-responsive"}
Now do the following: 
{% highlight bash %}
cd apps
sudo chown -R bitnami /opt/bitnami
sudo chown -R bitnami /home/bitnami
git clone https://github.com/yaoyuyang/angular-phonecat {USE YOUR LINK}
{% endhighlight %}

The `chown` steps are very important since the default owner for these two directories, which will be used later to write files, are root. If you don't change the ownership, you have to install everything under root and a lot of permission problems will pop up later.

# Run the app
Before you run the app, edit the `package.json` using your favorite editor. Replace `localhost` with `0.0.0.0`. This step and the Security Access steps in the next section expose your app to the public internet.

Now you can run the app by the following:

{% highlight bash %}
cd angular-phonecat
npm start
{% endhighlight %}

You should see something in the terminal like:

{% highlight bash %}
Starting up http-server, serving ./app
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:8000
  http://172.31.6.114:8000 (This will be your private IPs)
{% endhighlight %}

# Security Access
Your Angular app is now running. However, you need to configure the security access on AWS before you can let the world to see your app for real.

Open up your AWS EC2 dashboard, click Security Groups on the left panel. Click on the row that has Group name MEAN powered by Bitnami. Then click the inbound tab beneath. We need to customize the rules to make port 8000 accessible. Click Add Rule, leave Protocol default as TCP, in Port Range enter 8000, and Source choose Anywhere. Click Save. Refresh and you should see the following:
![security-access](/images/blog/security-access.png){:class="img-responsive"}

# Check out your running app on browser
After we give the security access. We can now access our app through a brower. Type in your Public DNS:8000. In my case it's [http://ec2-34-210-41-187.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000](http://ec2-34-210-41-187.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000). Hooray! You should now see the Google Phone Gallery up!

# Forever run
To keep the app running continuouly without being affected by logging out of EC2 instance. We use the node package `forever.js`. First `ctrl+c` to stop the existing app running. Install the package:
{% highlight bash %}
sudo npm install forever -g
{% endhighlight %}

And then start the app by: 
{% highlight bash %}
forever start ./node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server ./app -p 8000 -d false
{% endhighlight %}

To stop the app. Use `forever list` then `forever stop` with the id, e.g. `forever stop 12305`.
