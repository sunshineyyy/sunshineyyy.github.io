      I'm Yaoyu Yang. I am an engineer and researcher. I currently work at <a href="http://www.ginkgobioworks.com/" target="_blank">Ginkgo Bioworks</a> as a senior software engineer with the aim of making biology easier to engineer through software.

      <p>I recently obtained my Ph.D. in  <a href="http://www.ee.washington.edu/" target="_blank">Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.washington.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington</a>, where I worked on synthetic biology and lab automation in the <a href="http://klavinslab.org/" target="_blank">Klavins Lab</a>. My Ph.D. thesis is titled <a href="/thesis/YYTHESIS.pdf">Design, Construction, and Validation of Dynamic Gene Circuits in Yeast</a>. I built novel synthetic gene circuits in yeast. I also built over 20 high quality, reproducible build and test workflows in the <a href="http://klavinslab.org/aquarium.html" target="_blank">Aquarium lab operating system</a>, a software-enabled human-in-the-loop automation platform invented in the Klavins Lab. I am a founding member of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/uwbiofab/" target="_blank">UW Biofabrication Center (UW BIOFAB)</a>, a cloud lab service powered by <a href="http://klavinslab.org/aquarium" target="_blank">Aquarium</a>.

      I studied <a href="http://www.automation.sjtu.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank">automation</a> in my undergraduate at <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>. I was intersted in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory" target="_blank">control theory</a> and its applications in electronic and electrical systems. At <a href="http://www.washington.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington</a>, I was fascinated by the emerging area of <a href="http://www.synberc.org/what-is-synbio" target="_blank">synthetic biology</a> where I could apply my knowledge in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation" target="_blank">automation</a> to engineer biological systems that lead to disruptive innovations in biotechnology. In <a href="http://klavinslab.org/" target="_blank">Klavins Lab</a>, I worked on several <a href="/research">research projects</a> in synthetic biology with the aim of designing, building, and testing synthetic dynamic gene circuits. I worked greatly on building high quality, reproducible build and test workflows in the <a href="http://klavinslab.org/aquarium.html" target="_blank">Aquarium lab oprating system</a>, which we invented in the Klavins Lab. I also worked as an engineer building commercial solutions at Aquarium LLC, a startup based on <a href="http://klavinslab.org/aquarium.html" target="_blank">Aquarium</a>.</p>
