      Hi, I'm Yaoyu Yang. I recently earned my Ph.D. in  <a href="http://www.ee.washington.edu/" target="_blank">Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.washington.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington</a>, where I worked on synthetic biology and lab automation in the <a href="http://klavinslab.org/" target="_blank">Klavins Lab</a>. I was a founding member of <a href="http://uwbiofab.org/" target="_blank">UW Biofabrication Center (UW BIOFAB)</a> and worked there as a software engineer leading the workflow development. I'll join <a href="http://www.ginkgobioworks.com/" target="_blank">Ginkgo Bioworks</a> as a senior software engineer starting in Feb 2017.

      I studied <a href="http://www.automation.sjtu.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank">automation</a> in my undergraduate at <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>. I was intersted in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory" target="_blank">control theory</a> and its applications in electronic and electrical systems. I began my graduate study in UW EE in fall 2011 and found myself fascinated by the emerging area of <a href="http://www.synberc.org/what-is-synbio" target="_blank">synthetic biology</a> where I could apply my knowledge in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation" target="_blank">automation</a> to engineer biological systems, which could potentially lead to disruptive innovations in biotechnology. I joined <a href="http://klavinslab.org/" target="_blank">Klavins Lab</a> since then and have been working on several <a href="/research">research projects</a> in synthetic biology with the aim of designing, building, and testing synthetic dynamic gene circuits. I worked greatly on building high quality, reproducible build and test workflows in the <a href="http://klavinslab.org/aquarium.html" target="_blank">Aquarium lab oprating system</a> , which we invented in the Klavins Lab. I also worked as an engineer building commercial solutions at <a href="http://www.aquarium.bio/" target="_blank">Aquarium</a>.</p>

      <p>Outside lab and work, I enjoy reading, making <a href="/apps">cool apps</a>, and helping with my wife's <a href='http://dianbridal.com/' target="_blank">bridal startup</a>.
